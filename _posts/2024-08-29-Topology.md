As quantum computing continues to advance, the architecture of quantum processing units (QPUs) is becoming increasingly critical to the performance of quantum circuits, the backbone of all quantum algorithms. A key factor influencing the design of these circuits is qubit connectivityâ€”how qubits are arranged and interact within a QPU. Different quantum platforms exhibit unique connectivity patterns that directly impact how quantum circuits are implemented and optimized.

In this post, we will explore how qubit connectivity patterns shape circuit design and influence performance across various quantum architectures, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, photonic qubits, and neutral atom qubits. We will highlight the significance of qubit layout in superconducting quantum computers as our Helmi QPU uses superconducting technology. To illustrate these concepts, we will present a specific example involving the encoded Grover's search algorithm, demonstrating how different connectivity models necessitate tailored approaches to circuit design.

This post aims to shed light on how thoughtful consideration of QPU qubit layout in circuit design can lead to significant performance improvements.

## Qubit Connectivity Across Different Quantum Architectures

Different quantum computing concepts, such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and photonic qubits, each have unique qubit connectivity patterns. This connectivity refers to how qubits are physically arranged and how they can interact with one another. The nature of this connectivity directly impacts how quantum circuits are designed and executed.

1. **Superconducting Qubits:**

   Superconducting quantum computers arrange qubits in a 2D grid pattern on a chip, where each qubit typically interacts with its nearest neighbors, forming a lattice-like connectivity [[1]](#references). The strength of the interaction, or coupling, between qubits is largely determined by their physical proximity. The grid layout requires careful circuit design to minimize the need for long-range interactions, which require additional operation such as SWAP gates to bring qubits closer together. Superconducting qubits are controlled using microwave electronics and pulse shaping techniques [[2]](#references). However, these qubits are prone to imperfections such as decoherence, crosstalk, and leakage to non-computational states [[3]](#references). Circuit designs must therefore optimize qubit placement and operation sequences to mitigate these imperfections, aiming to reduce circuit depth and improve overall performance.

    </figure>


2. **Trapped Ion Qubits:**

   In trapped ion quantum computers, ions (used as qubits in this system) are often arranged in a linear or slightly two-dimensional chain [[4]](#references). Any qubit in a trapped ion system can, in theory, interact with any other qubit, offering all-to-all connectivity [[5]](#references). This flexibility reduces the need for additional operations like SWAP gates, potentially lowering circuit complexity. However, trapped ion systems are susceptible to readout bit flips, shuttling errors, and charge noise. Effective circuit design must manage these imperfections by ensuring robust control signals and maintaining qubit coherence over long ion chains to fully exploit the flexibility offered by this architecture [[6]](#references).

    </figure>
    

3. **Photonic Qubits:**

   Photonic quantum computers use light particles (photons) as qubits. Unlike other qubit systems, photonic qubits are not confined to a fixed spatial arrangement. Instead, they are typically guided through optical circuits using waveguides or fibers . The connectivity in photonic systems is determined by the design of these optical paths and components, such as beam splitters, waveplates, and phase shifters, which direct and manipulate the photons. This bring the advantages of long-distance quantum communication with excellent coherence time, while challenges such as optical loss, stray photons and static fabrication defects must be addressed [[7, 8, 9]](#references).

4. **Neutral Atom Qubits:**

    Neutral atom quantum computers arrange individual atoms (qubits) in a 2D or 3D array, which that can be dynamically reconfigured [[10]](#references). These atoms are typically manipulated and controlled using focused laser beams, known as optical tweezers, which trap and move the atoms to desired locations within the array. The interactions between qubits are controlled by adjusting the laser fields to induce interactions such as Rydberg states, enabling gate operations [[11]](#references). This flexibility in control is advantageous for optimizing qubit interactions in real-time to meet specific circuit requirements. However, the neutral atom systems are prone to issues such as imperfect readout, qubit re-trapping, and shot-to-shot control variance from atomic motion [[12]](#references).

## Why Qubit Layout Matters in Superconducting Quantum Circuit Design

1. **Optimizing Gate Implementation:**

   The layout of QPU directly affects how quantum gates, especially multi-qubit gates, are implemented. In superconducting quantum circuit, qubit layout must be carefully planned to minimize the need for SWAP gates. SWAP gates, necessary for repositioning qubits to interact, increase the circuit depth and introduce additional opportunities for errors. By optimizing the layout to align with the natural connectivity of the qubits, researchers can significantly reduce the number of SWAP operations, thus improving the overall fidelity and efficiency of the quantum computation. Even in architectures with more flexible connectivity, such as trapped ions, optimizing the layout can reduce latency and improve gate execution times.

2. **Enhancing Scalability:**

   As quantum computers grow in size and complexity, maintaining efficient and scalable circuit designs becomes increasingly challenging. The qubit layout must support the scaling of the system without a corresponding increase in error rates or operational complexity. This is particularly crucial in systems like superconducting qubits, where adding more qubits can complicate the connectivity and control architecture.

3. **Supporting Quantum Error Correction:**

    Quantum error correction (QEC) is important for achieving fault tolerance in large-scale quantum computers. Effective QEC codes, such as the surface code which has low error threshold, require specific qubit arrangements, typically a 2D grid with nearest interactions. This layout supports the implementation of stablizer measurement which is used for error detecting and correcting. Therefore, the physical qubit layout be designed to facilitate these measurements while minimizing the additional overhead like SWAP gates. Considering the qubit layout early in the designing circuit ensures the circuit is well-prepared to implement fault-tolerant operations. 

4. **Beyond Fault Tolerance: The Importance of Topology**

   While fault tolerance has been a major focus in the development of quantum circuits, it is equally important to consider the physical topology of qubits, especially given the current state of quantum technology. In today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, where coherence times are limited and noise levels are high, optimizing based on qubit topology can significantly improve circuit performance even before error correction is applied. By carefully designing the qubit topology, researchers can enhance the performance of quantum circuits, maximizing their capability before the implementation of full error correction. This consideration is not just about preparing for future fault-tolerant quantum computers but also about extracting the maximum potential from the quantum systems we have today.

## Experiment: Comparing Circuit Design with Different Layouts

This experiment explores the impact of qubit layout on the performance of two implementations of the encoded Grover's search algorithm. Although both circuits perform the same logical function, they differ in their encoding and decoding stages. These stages, while logically equivalent, are implemented differently, resulting in variations in the analysis stage to match the encoded outcome with the logical input. More details about how this encoded version of Grover's search be implemented can be found [here](https://fiqci.fi/_posts/2024-08-26-Grover-Error-Detecting/).

Encoded version 1 is taken from a research of Pokharel and Lidar [[12]](#references). Encoded Version 2 builds upon Version 1 but employs a different encoding method that better matches the layout of the Helmi, our 5-qubit QPU. Both circuits perform the same function, but Circuit 2 aligns better with the star-shaped topology, eliminate the need for SWAP gates when running on Helmi.

### Experiment Result

When these circuits were run on our 5-qubit QPU, Circuit 1 outperformed Circuit 2, demonstrating greater efficiency due to the layout-optimized design. This experiment highlights how even the same logical circuit can yield different results depending on how well the physical qubit layout matches the hardware's connectivity. On average, the 1st version of circuit perform $1.6$ times better than the 2nd version.

## Conclusion

Qubit connectivity plays a crucial role in the performance and efficiency of quantum circuits across various quantum computing architectures. By carefully considering and optimizing qubit layout, especially in superconducting quantum computers like our Helmi QPU, we can significantly enhance the execution of quantum algorithms. The example of the encoded Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that tailored circuit design, aligned with the specific connectivity model of a QPU, is essential for achieving optimal performance. This approach highlights the potential of current hardware, demonstrating that even before we reach fault-tolerant devices, thoughtful design can maximize the usability and effectiveness of today's quantum systems.
